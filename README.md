# symfony Cookbook

## Requirements

###Cookbooks
The following cookbooks are direct dependencies because they're used for common "default" functionality.

- [nginx](https://github.com/opscode-cookbooks/nginx)
- [php](https://github.com/opscode-cookbooks/php) 
- [php-fpm](https://github.com/yevgenko/cookbook-php-fpm)

The following cookbook is not a strict dependency because its use can be controlled by an attribute, so it may not be a common "default."
- [rvm](https://github.com/opscode-cookbooks/nginx) (for sass)

###Platforms
The following platforms are supported:

- Ubuntu 10.04, Ubuntu 12.04
- CentOS 5.8, 6.3

Other Debian and RHEL family distributions are assumed to work.
